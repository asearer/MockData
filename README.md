# **MockData Directory**

The **MockData** directory contains a comprehensive collection of simulated datasets designed for use in various applications, including testing, data visualization, and analysis. These datasets cover a range of domains, including health, clinical trials, financial records, business data, communications, Marvel characters, sports, statistical analysis, and network performance. Currently, the repository contains JSON files, with plans to expand and update the datasets to include SQL and MongoDB formats in the future.

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this directory is to provide realistic, yet fictional data that can be used to:

- **Test Applications:** Ensure that your applications handle data correctly and perform as expected.

- **Develop and Demonstrate Features:** Use simulated data to build and showcase features without relying on sensitive or real-world data.

- **Visualize and Analyze Data:** Create visualizations and conduct analyses to understand data patterns and trends using mock data.

## **Directory Structure**

The directory is organized into subdirectories based on the type of data:
