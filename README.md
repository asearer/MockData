# **MockData Directory**

The **MockData** directory contains a comprehensive collection of simulated datasets designed for use in various applications, including testing, data visualization, and analysis. These datasets cover a range of domains, including health, clinical trials, financial records, business data, communications, Marvel characters, sports, statistical analysis, and network performance.

In addition to JSON files, the repository now includes SQL seed files that provide a structured way to populate databases with mock data. This expansion facilitates easier integration with SQL-based applications and allows for more realistic testing scenarios.

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this directory is to provide realistic, yet fictional data that can be used to:

- **Test Applications:** Ensure that your applications handle data correctly and perform as expected.
  
- **Develop and Demonstrate Features:** Use simulated data to build and showcase features without relying on sensitive or real-world data.
  
- **Visualize and Analyze Data:** Create visualizations and conduct analyses to understand data patterns and trends using mock data.
  
- **Seed Databases:** Populate SQL databases with mock data to simulate real-world scenarios and test database interactions.

## **Directory Structure**

The directory is organized into subdirectories based on the type of data:
